                    <h3>Drawing</h3>
                    <p>Drawing helps me relax. It helps me forget about all of the stressful things in my mind even just for a few moments. I usually draw using the references that i found on pinterest although i can draw or sketch things purely out of my own imaginations. I usually have to do a lot of brainstorming if it's purely out of my own imaginations.</p>

                    <h3>Novels</h3>
                    <p>I like reading novels during my spare time, specifically mystery, thriller, horror, and slice of life novels. I also enjoy exploring the depth and beauty of classical storytelling. Classical novels simply has a timeless feel to it.</p>

            <h2>Why These Interests?</h2>
            <p>My hobbies complement my studies perfectly. Drawing enhances my creativity and attention to detail—skills that are valuable in programming and problem-solving. Reading classical novels teaches me about narrative structure, complex systems, and human nature, which surprisingly connects to how we design software and user experiences.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">I believe that being a well-rounded person makes me a better computer scientist. The analytical thinking from CS combined with the creativity from art and literature gives me a unique perspective on technology.</p>
